07.27.2021 10:30am (V1.0.0) - Basic structure setup and deployed.

07.28.2021 1:30pm (v1.0.1) - Added form to allow entry of a city with a button to click that will submit the form. An API call is done to locationIQ to retrieve the data for that city.

Error messages will show if some issue happens with the API call.
